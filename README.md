### 2. Problem Statement

Calculate the price of swaptions using machine learning.

---

### 3. Motivation / Why This Problem

Swaption pricing is computationally intensive and often relies on simplified assumptions that don't capture real market dynamics. Traditional Monte Carlo simulations can take hours for accurate pricing, leading to delayed trading decisions and increased risk exposure. With the growing complexity of financial derivatives, there's an urgent need for faster, more accurate pricing methods that can handle high-dimensional financial data and complex volatility structures.

---

### 4. Proposed Solution

We developed a quantum-enhanced swaption pricing platform that leverages Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) to overcome traditional limitations. Our solution uses quantum computing's parallel processing capabilities for faster, more accurate pricing by encoding financial data into quantum states and training quantum circuits to learn complex pricing patterns.

### 6. Implementation Details

#### Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Approach
A Quantum Neural Network (QNN) encodes financial data into quantum states, processes them through quantum gates, and measures the output to predict swaption prices. The model is trained by adjusting circuit parameters using classical optimizers.

#### Best QNN Types for Swaption Pricing
- **Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)**: Good for modeling complex patterns in yield curves
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical QNN**: Combines quantum layers with classical layers for fine-tuning
- **Quantum Kernel Model (QKM)**: Best when limited data samples are available

#### Pseudo Algorithm for Swaption Pricing using QNN

1. **Collect historical market data**: yield curves, volatilities, strikes, maturities, prices
2. **Preprocess data** → normalize features
3. **Encode data into quantum states** (using angle or amplitude encoding)
4. **Define quantum circuit (ansatz)** with trainable parameters
5. **Measure output** → get predicted swaption price
6. **Compute loss** = (predicted price - true price)²
7. **Update parameters** using a classical optimizer
8. **Repeat steps 3–7** until loss is minimized
9. **Test the model** on unseen data for evaluation
10. **Use the trained QNN** to predict new swaption prices instantly
