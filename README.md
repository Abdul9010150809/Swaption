# Quantum-finance-swaping-

A quantum-enhanced financial analytics platform for swaption pricing and risk management. Financial institutions struggle with slow and inaccurate swaption pricing using traditional methods. The main challenges are computational complexity and unrealistic market assumptions. This affects trading profits, risk management, and regulatory compliance.

Our solution uses quantum machine learning to overcome these limitations by leveraging quantum computing's parallel processing capabilities for faster, more accurate pricing.

## 🚀 Solution Architecture

### Frontend Layer
React dashboard for traders to input parameters and view real-time pricing results with quantum circuit visualizations.

### API Gateway Layer
Node.js service handling security and request routing between frontend and quantum services.

### Quantum Computing Layer
Qiskit-based quantum algorithms running on simulators and IBM Quantum hardware for core pricing calculations.

### Classical ML Layer
Traditional machine learning models that work alongside quantum algorithms for hybrid processing.

### Infrastructure Foundation
Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration, supporting both classical and quantum computing resources.

## 🧠 Quantum Machine Learning

### Quantum Data Strategy
We use quantum amplitude encoding to represent financial data in quantum states, allowing exponential compression of market information. This enables processing complex yield curves and volatility surfaces that are challenging for classical systems.

### Quantum Algorithm Development
Our approach combines quantum amplitude estimation with machine learning to price swaptions. Quantum circuits are designed to estimate probabilities and expected values more efficiently than classical Monte Carlo methods.

### Hybrid Model Training
We train quantum-classical hybrid models where quantum processors handle complex pattern recognition while classical systems manage data preprocessing and post-processing. This leverages the strengths of both computing paradigms.

### Quantum Advantage Focus
The system specifically targets problems where quantum computing shows potential advantage: option pricing, portfolio optimization, and risk calculation using quantum amplitude estimation and quantum Fourier transforms.

## 🔬 Quantum Algorithms for Swaption Pricing

Swaptions can be priced using machine learning by training a model to learn how market data (like yield curves, volatility, strike, and maturity) affect the swaption price. For example, you can give the model past market conditions and their corresponding swaption prices, and it learns to predict prices for new market conditions.

### Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Approach
A Quantum Neural Network (QNN) is a special kind of model that uses quantum circuits instead of just classical layers. It encodes financial data into quantum states, passes them through quantum gates (which act like layers), and measures the output to get a predicted price. The model is trained by adjusting circuit parameters using a classical optimizer until the predicted prices are close to real prices.

### Best QNN Types for Swaption Pricing
- **Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)**: Good for modeling complex patterns in yield curves
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical QNN**: Combines quantum layers (for pattern extraction) with classical layers (for fine-tuning and output)
- **Quantum Kernel Model (QKM)**: Best when you have fewer data samples but want to capture nonlinear relationships

### Pseudo Algorithm for Swaption Pricing using QNN

1. **Collect historical market data**: yield curves, volatilities, strikes, maturities, prices
2. **Preprocess data** → normalize features
3. **Encode data into quantum states** (using angle or amplitude encoding)
4. **Define quantum circuit (ansatz)** with trainable parameters
5. **Measure output** → get predicted swaption price
6. **Compute loss** = (predicted price - true price)²
7. **Update parameters** using a classical optimizer
8. **Repeat steps 3–7** until loss is minimized
9. **Test the model** on unseen data for evaluation
10. **Use the trained QNN** to predict new swaption prices instantly

### Why Choose QNN?
QNNs are chosen because they can learn complex and nonlinear patterns in financial data better than traditional models. They use fewer parameters, generalize well even with limited data, and offer faster predictions than simulation-based pricing methods like Monte Carlo. This makes them ideal for real-time and high-dimensional swaption pricing.
