  - Fallback to analytical Black-Scholes pricing when ML models are unavailable
  - Regular model validation against market data
  - Input parameter validation and bounds checking

#### System Performance
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Description**: High latency or system unavailability during peak usage periods.
- **Impact**: Trading delays, user dissatisfaction
- **Mitigation**:
  - Horizontal scaling capabilities
  - Caching layer for frequently requested calculations
  - Performance monitoring and alerting
  - Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls

#### Data Quality
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Description**: Poor quality input data leading to incorrect pricing.
- **Impact**: Incorrect pricing, financial losses
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Data quality monitoring
  - Outlier detection and handling
  - Audit logging of all calculations

### 2. Operational Risks

#### System Availability
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Description**: System downtime due to hardware failures, software bugs, or maintenance.
- **Impact**: Business interruption, loss of revenue
- **Mitigation**:
  - Redundant infrastructure
  - Automated failover mechanisms
  - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
  - Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Description**: Unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.
- **Impact**: Data theft, financial fraud, regulatory violations
- **Mitigation**:
  - Multi-layered security architecture
  - Encryption of sensitive data
  - Regular security audits and penetration testing
  - Access control and authentication mechanisms

#### Third-Party Dependencies
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Description**: Reliance on external services (Redis, cloud infrastructure, etc.).
- **Impact**: Service disruption if dependencies fail
- **Mitigation**:
  - Circuit breaker patterns
  - Graceful degradation strategies
  - Multiple provider redundancy where possible
  - Regular dependency health monitoring

### 3. Financial Risks

#### Pricing Errors
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Description**: Incorrect pricing leading to financial losses for users.
- **Impact**: Direct financial losses, legal liability
- **Mitigation**:
  - Multiple pricing model validation
  - Confidence interval reporting
  - Clear disclaimers about model limitations
  - Professional liability insurance

#### Market Risk
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Description**: Models become outdated due to changing market conditions.
- **Impact**: Reduced accuracy over time
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regular model retraining with new data
  - Drift detection mechanisms
  - Model versioning and rollback capabilities
  - Market condition monitoring

#### Liquidity Risk
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Description**: System unable to handle sudden spikes in usage.
- **Impact**: Service degradation during high demand
- **Mitigation**:
  - Auto-scaling infrastructure
  - Load balancing
  - Capacity planning and stress testing
  - Usage throttling mechanisms

### 4. Compliance and Regulatory Risks

#### Regulatory Compliance
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Description**: Failure to comply with financial regulations (MiFID II, Dodd-Frank, etc.).
- **Impact**: Fines, legal action, business restrictions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regular compliance audits
  - Documentation of all calculations
  - Clear regulatory disclaimers
  - Legal review of terms of service

#### Data Privacy
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Description**: Mishandling of user data or pricing information.
- **Impact**: Privacy violations, legal penalties
- **Mitigation**:
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance
  - Data minimization principles
  - User consent management
  - Data retention policies

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Controls
1. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated against expected ranges and formats
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of system health and performance
4. **Testing**: Automated testing including unit, integration, and performance tests
5. **Backup Systems**: Analytical pricing as fallback when ML models fail

### Operational Controls
1. **Access Control**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
2. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
3. **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for handling security incidents
4. **Business Continuity**: Disaster recovery and business continuity plans
5. **Vendor Management**: Regular assessment of third-party providers

### Financial Controls
1. **Model Validation**: Regular validation of pricing models against market data
2. **Risk Limits**: Implementation of position limits and exposure controls
3. **Stress Testing**: Regular stress testing under various market scenarios
4. **Insurance**: Appropriate insurance coverage for professional liability

## Risk Monitoring and Reporting

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- Model accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE)
- System uptime and availability
- Response time percentiles
- Error rates by endpoint
- Security incident frequency
- Compliance audit results

### Reporting Frequency
- **Daily**: System health and performance metrics
- **Weekly**: Model accuracy and drift detection
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive risk assessment
- **Quarterly**: Regulatory compliance review
- **Annually**: Full risk assessment update

## Contingency Plans

### Model Failure
- **Trigger**: Model accuracy drops below threshold
- **Response**:
  1. Alert risk management team
  2. Switch to analytical pricing fallback
  3. Initiate model retraining process
  4. Communicate with users about temporary changes

### System Outage
- **Trigger**: System unavailable for > 5 minutes
- **Response**:
  1. Activate incident response team
  2. Assess impact and communicate with users
  3. Implement workaround procedures
  4. Restore service and conduct post-mortem

### Security Incident
- **Trigger**: Suspected security breach
- **Response**:
  1. Isolate affected systems
  2. Notify relevant authorities
  3. Conduct forensic analysis
  4. Implement remediation measures
  5. Communicate with affected parties
