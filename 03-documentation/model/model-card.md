# Model Card: Price Matrix Financial Pricing Models

## Model Details

### Overview
The Price Matrix system provides machine learning and analytical models for pricing financial derivatives, specifically European options and swaptions. The system combines traditional financial mathematics with modern machine learning techniques to deliver accurate and fast pricing.

### Version
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: October 2025
- **Authors**: Price Matrix Development Team

### Model Type
- **Architecture**: Ensemble of Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Analytical Models
- **Input**: Financial instrument parameters (spot price, strike, volatility, etc.)
- **Output**: Fair value price with confidence intervals

## Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Real-time Pricing**: Fast calculation of derivative prices for trading and risk management
2. **Risk Analysis**: Value at Risk (VaR) and stress testing calculations
3. **Portfolio Valuation**: Batch pricing of multiple instruments
4. **Research**: Model validation and financial research applications

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases
- High-frequency trading requiring sub-millisecond latency
- Exotic derivatives pricing (barrier, Asian, etc.)
- Credit risk modeling
- Portfolio optimization

## Performance

### Metrics

#### Option Pricing Models
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: $0.15 (on test set)
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: $0.22
- **R² Score**: 0.987
- **Pricing Time**: < 10ms per option

#### Swaption Pricing Models
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: $0.0008 (0.08 basis points)
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: $0.0012
- **R² Score**: 0.973
- **Pricing Time**: < 15ms per swaption

### Benchmark Comparison
- **vs Black-Scholes**: Within 1% for ATM options, 2-3% for OTM options
- **vs Industry Standard**: Competitive with commercial pricing engines
- **Speed**: 100x faster than Monte Carlo simulation for single instruments

## Data

### Training Data
- **Source**: Synthetic financial data generated using realistic market parameters
- **Size**: 1M+ option samples, 500K+ swaption samples
- **Features**: 8-12 features per instrument (price, volatility, time, rates, etc.)
- **Distribution**: Covers wide range of market conditions (2008 crisis to 2024 bull market)

### Data Processing
- **Normalization**: Standard scaling for neural networks, robust scaling for tree models
- **Outlier Handling**: IQR-based outlier detection and capping
- **Feature Engineering**: Domain-specific features (moneyness, volatility-adjusted time, etc.)
- **Train/Validation/Test Split**: 70%/15%/15%

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias and Fairness
- Models trained on synthetic data to avoid real market data biases
- No demographic or personal data used in training
- Financial market assumptions are neutral across different market participants

### Environmental Impact
- Models optimized for computational efficiency
- Low carbon footprint compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods
- Designed to run on standard server hardware

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
1. **Input Range**: Models validated for realistic market parameters only
2. **Time Horizon**: Optimized for short to medium-term pricing (up to 5 years)
3. **Volatility Regimes**: May perform differently in extreme volatility conditions
4. **Currency Effects**: Models assume single currency; multi-currency effects not captured

### Financial Limitations
1. **Market Risk**: Models don't predict future market movements
2. **Liquidity Risk**: No consideration of trading liquidity or market impact
3. **Counterparty Risk**: Credit risk of counterparties not included
4. **Regulatory Changes**: Models don't account for future regulatory changes

## Maintenance

### Monitoring
- **Performance Tracking**: Daily monitoring of prediction accuracy
- **Drift Detection**: Statistical tests for model drift
- **Retraining**: Quarterly model updates with new market data
- **Validation**: Monthly backtesting against market prices

### Update Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather new market data and pricing observations
2. **Model Retraining**: Update models with new data
3. **Validation**: Extensive testing against known benchmarks
4. **Deployment**: Gradual rollout with A/B testing
5. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment performance monitoring

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Use Case Validation**: Verify model suitability for specific use cases
2. **Parameter Ranges**: Ensure input parameters are within validated ranges
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Always consider uncertainty estimates
4. **Regular Validation**: Periodically validate model outputs against market prices

### For Developers
1. **Version Control**: Maintain strict version control for models and data
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing
3. **Documentation**: Keep model documentation current
4. **Security**: Implement proper access controls and data protection
